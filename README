BelongsToDemeter
================

BelongsToDemeter is a Rails plugin that lets you access attributes of a
belongs_to association through methods on the base class. It's poor code, but a
fun idea.

Example
=======

# The next line will do a User.find_by_login('bob') and assign it to
# @character.user
@character.user_login = "bob"

# You can then fetch the user's name by doing
@character.user_name = "Bob Jones"
